This is one of many scripts in a Democracy Works project to help voters get to the polls. The data I scraped and parsed was passed to Google Maps. Before this project there was no national public database of early polling hours, locations, and voting official phone numbers. That information -- for thousands of jurisdictions in the country -- was only, at best, to be found on state government websites, organized by county. The state government websites are all formatted differently. I scraped each state website differently, using Mechanize to click through the links and Nokogiri to drill down into the right data based on css selectors. I then matched it with the right Open Civic Data ID code from another file. I used the Ruby CSV gem to put it in a spreadsheet to send to Google.
